## Tmux (use Tmux in Neovim ???)

|Syntax   |Description            |
|-------- |---------------------- |
|C-a      | prefix                |
|prefix r | reload  .tmux.conf    |

## Neovim

In my case, <leader> is a space.

|Syntax |Description |
|------ |----------- |
|<leader>pv | come back from file to directories/project view |
|<leader>gs | git status (need git repo) (figutive) |
|<leader>a | add to harpoon |
